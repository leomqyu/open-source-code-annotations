"""
In this document we'll implement basically the simplest possible Triton GPU Kernel, which does entry-wise
addition for vectors. 

What you'll learn:
- How to build a test to ensure your Triton kernels are numerically correct
- Basics of Triton kernels (syntax, pointers, launch grids, DRAM vs SRAM, etc)
- How to benchmark your Triton kernels against PyTorch

Recommended order to read the code in:
Step 1 - unit test
Step 2 - wrapper
Step 3 - kernel
Step 4 - benchmark

    """
    This entry-wise addition kernel is relativevly simple; it's designed to only
     take in vectors as input and does not support any kind of broadcasting

    Each torch.tensor object that gets passed into a Triton kernelis implicitly 
     converted into a pointer to its first element

    x_ptr:          pointer to first entry of input vector of shape (n_elements)
    y_ptr:          pointer to first entry of input vector of shape (n_elements)
    output_ptr:     pointer to first entry of output vector of shape (n_elements)
    n_elements:     size of our vectors
    BLOCK_SIZE:     number of elements each kernel instance should process; should be a power of 2
    
    tl.constexpr designates BLOCK_SIZE as a compile-time variable (rather than run-time), 
     meaning that every time a different value for BLOCK_SIZE is passed in you're actually 
     creating an entirely separate kernel. I may sometimes refer to arguments with this 
     designation as "meta-parameters"

    # There are multiple "programs" processing data; a program is a unique instantiation of this kernel.
    # Programs can be defined along multiple dimensions (defined by your launch grid in the wrapper).
    # this op is 1D so axis=0 is the only option, but bigger operations later may define program_id as a tuple
    # here we identify which program we are:
    pid = tl.program_id(axis=0) 
        # Each program instance gets a unique ID along the specified axis
        # For example, for a vector of length 256 and BLOCK_SIZE=64:
        # pid=0 might processe elements [0:64]
        # pid=1 might processe elements [64:128]
        # pid=2 might processe elements [128:192]
        # pid=3 might processe elements [192:256]
        # I said "might" because the specific elements that get processed depend on the code below

    # herewe tell the program to process inputs that are offset from the initial data (^ described above)
    block_start = pid * BLOCK_SIZE

    # offsets is an array of int32 that act as pointers
    offsets = block_start + tl.arange(0, BLOCK_SIZE)
        # sticking with the above example, if pid=1 then offsets=[64, 65, 66, ...., 126, 127]

    # create a mask to guard memory operations against out-of-bounds accesses
    mask = offsets < n_elements
        # if we didn't do this AND n_elements were not a multiple of BLOCK_SIZE then
        #  the kernel might read entries that are actually part of some other tensor in memory
        #  and use them in calculations

    # here load x and y 
        # from (DRAM / VRAM / global GPU memory / high-bandwidth memory) which is slow to access
        # onto (SRAM / on-chip memory) which is much faster but very limited in size.
        # We store data not currently in-use on DRAM and do calculations on data that's in SRAM
    x = tl.load(x_ptr + offsets, mask=mask, other=None) # shape (BLOCK_SIZE)
    y = tl.load(y_ptr + offsets, mask=mask, other=None) # shape (BLOCK_SIZE)
        # The mask ensures we don't access memory beyond the vector's end.
        # `other` refers to what value to put in place of any masked-out values; it defaults
        #  to None (so we didn't have to actually write it here) but depending on the operation
        #  it may make more sense to use a value like 0.0 (we'll see this in a later tutorial)
        # Whenever you see a tl.load that is a memory operation which is expensive so we want to
        #  keep track of how many memory operations we do. We count them by the total number of
        #  entries being read/written to memory, in this case BLOCK_SIZE per kernel and 
        #  therefore n_elements in total across all running kernels for EACH of these two lines

    # here we perform the operation on SRAM
    # triton has its own internal definitions of all the basic ops that you'll need
    output = x + y
        # For the masked-out entries, None + None = None (really no operation happens at all).
        # Similar to keeping track of memory operations, we also keep track of floating point 
        #  operations (flops) using the shape of the blocks involved. Here this line does BLOCK_SIZE
        #  flops for each pid, meaning n_elements flops total


    # write back to DRAM, being sure to mask in order to avoid out-of-bounds accesses
    tl.store(output_ptr + offsets, output, mask=mask)
        # here is a memory write operation of size BLOCK_SIZE per pid and therefore n_elements 
        # in aggregate across all pids combined
